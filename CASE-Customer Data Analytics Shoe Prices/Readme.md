Inspiration
You can use this data to determine brand markups, pricing strategies, and trends for luxury shoes. E.g.:

What is the average price of each distinct brand listed?
Which brands have the highest prices?
Which ones have the widest distribution of prices?
Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands?
Correlate specific product features with changes in price.
